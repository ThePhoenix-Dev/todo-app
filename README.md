# Simple TODO-Tasks electron application
A simple Electron-Project - The easiest way to manage todos

This simple electron project i've made includes a few basics of electron. The app allows them to create, edit and delete tasks, which are displayed in a list. 

# How it works

Whenever you edit a task and then unfocus it, when you close the program or when you delete a task all of the tasks are being saved in a file called "todos" in "%userprofile%\AppData\Local\"
