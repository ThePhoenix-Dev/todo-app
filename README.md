# Simple TODO-Tasks electron application
A simple Electron-Project - The easiest way to manage todos

This simple electron project i've made includes a few basics of electron. The app allows them to create, edit and delete tasks, which are displayed in a list. 

# How it works

Whenever you edit a task and then unfocus it, when you close the program or when you delete a task all of the tasks are being saved in a file called "todos" in ```%userprofile%\AppData\Local\```

# How to run

To run the application you need **Node.js** and **Electron**. To run the program you either have to execute the **"start_application.sh"** file, for which you need the **Git** program or execute the command ```npm run start``` in a **Git Bash**. Here I can highly recommend this video, in which all the necessary steps are shown: https://youtu.be/TnXz_nnQZrw
